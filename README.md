This is a software package to create interactive and dynamic visualizations for clock-synchronization and messaging protocols in distributed systems. The program implements any arbitrary protocol defined by the user and displays its space-time diagram. As an example, the visualizations for Lamport Clocks (unicast and broadcast systems) have been shown below.
